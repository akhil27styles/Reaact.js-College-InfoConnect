College Info-Connect has been designed as a web based interface between the students and the faculty, facilitating interactions not limited to the classroom. The JSSATE Info-Connect aims to provide a live platform 
<br/>for fast exchange of information within college management, faculty and students to carry the overall functioning at various levels to a higher degree of quality and competence.
<br/>
The web-site can be accessed from within the college campus using- http://Info-Connect and from across the world using- http://www.jssaten.org.in.
<br/>
The Info-Connect provides a wide variety of utilities to its users. It can be spoken of as one place where the faculty and students alike can maintain their personal and academic records. The site provides individual user-accounts for faculty members and students with personal space and interface on "Info-Connect" website. The user can upload and edit personal information through this facility.
<br/>
Personal and public messaging by management and faculty is possible using the Info-Connect notice board. This facility aims at increasing the interaction between faculty and students while carrying the student-teacher relationship to a newer level of co-ordination and understanding. Not only that, there is provision for uploading of assignments and tutorials by faculty for various target batches and personal messaging about the uploading to the students will also be accomplished.

The Info-Connect also proposes to bring easier access to the UPTU end-semester results and their analysis. Comprehensive comparative reports of the result analysis will be available for all batches and branches with emphasis on relative performances and improvement in results over previous years.
